# Ghany Widito Baskoro

## Industrial Engeneering & Technology Management

```
While I worked as Management Development Program, I took Masters degree in Technology Management (M.M.) and
graduated in February 2022. Able to perform business operational simulations and do a feasibility study and financial
feasibility. Plunged into the IT industry as a Product Owner, understanding the SDLC concept, and managing front-end
services apps and ERP Financial Module applications. Accustomed to brainstorming and discussion in solving
problems using data analysis tools. My biggest fear is facing a learning decline, doing repetitive work for long periods
of time that can reduce insight of mindset and point of view.
